Hi, Dev! 💻

Be very welcome to my profile!

My name is Carolina de Abreu, from Brazil 🇧🇷

I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in electronic engineering⚡,
together with a mechatronics technician 🤖, at Senai SP, in SCS

As well, in my free time, between college and technician, I take some courses and develop web applications, in the front end areas with a little back end too.

• Jr Full Stack Developer

• Jr Front End Developer

Seeking an internship in the IT area, thus showing all my love for technology, with a lot of willpower to learn!

But free time, I usually listen to a lot of music ▶ ️,
code a little 👩‍💻 (for a change, right?)
and stay with my family and friends!

Did you like it? Thanks for the visit! 👋 ♥ ️

If you can, take a look at the projects!
